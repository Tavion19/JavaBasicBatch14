	Loops in Java - is a feature used to execute a particular part of the program repeatedly if a given condition evaluates to be true
	
	we use it for repetitive operations
	
	it allows us to execute a statement or group statements multiple times
	
	
	ex.
	
	int time=10;
	
	if (time<12) 
	{
	System.out.println("good morning");
	}
	
	while (time<12) {
	
	System.out.println("good morning");
	}
	
	
	
	while loop syntax
	
	while(boolean condition) {
	
	code to be repeated
