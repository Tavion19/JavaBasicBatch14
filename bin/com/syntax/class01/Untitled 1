Arrays:
	Arrays are consecutive memory locations which store same type of data.
	
Why do we need arrays?
	Arrays help us store large amounts of data in a single variable.
	For Example if we want to store the names of 100 students, we don't need to create 100 variables;
	we can simply create an array of size 100 and it will store the names.
Syntax(how to use):
	Data type [] name of array= new data type [size] ---> one way
	Data type [] name of array= bew data type []{store the elements}.
	For example an int array that stores three numbers
	int [] arr=new int[]{10,20,3,0};
