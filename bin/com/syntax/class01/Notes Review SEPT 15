Logical Operators:
	Logical operators he;p us test more than one condition. In java we have && as the And operator and the || Or operators and ! NOT.
	
Why should we learn Logical Operators?
	Logical operators help us reduce the number of if conditions that we write in certain cases.
	
What is the syntax?
	if(condition1 && condition2){
	sout"Hello";
	}
	
	if(condition1){
		if(condition2){
	sout"Hello";
	}
	
	
	}
