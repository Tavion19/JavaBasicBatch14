What is an object?
	Everything around us is an object. For example, Keyboard, mouse, glass, etc
	Objects cab be defined based on how they look and how they behave.
	Objects in computer programming are very similar.
	They have states(which helps us define how that object looks like) and 
	behaviors(what the object does)

What is a class? 
	Class is a blueprint/design/template from which we create the objects


Object oriented programming:(OOP)
	It is just a way of writing code or
	Is just a way of writing programs. 
	There are other ways as well like functional programming.
Why we should learn OOP?
	It helps us maintain and modify the code easily.
	It simplifies the development of large programs.
	It will also help us maintain and modify existing code.
	It helps us write more secure code
	It helps us avoid duplicate code

What is the Syntax?


Main pillars of OOP
	1. Classes and objects
	2. Inheritance
	3. Polymorphism
	4. Abstraction
	5. Encapsulation

Classes and objects?
	A Class is a template/blueprint from which we create the objects
	An object is programming is very similar to the objects that we have in real life.
	
Object:
	Object have states that defines how the object looks like. We define the states with the help 
	of Attributes/properties/fields inside a class/
	
	Objects can also have behaviors(Things the object can do).
