Type Casting:
-Type Casting is converting the type of data from one type of data to another one. 

We have 2 types of type casting:
	1. -Explicit/Narrowing/Manual
	2. - Implicit/widening/automatic
	
	When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one : Explicit/narrowing/manual
	When we go from a smaller data type to a larger one : Implicit/widening/automatic
	
	1. Byte (8)
	2. Short (16), Char(16)
	3. Int (32)
	4. Long (64)
	5. Float (32)	3222 3.2*1000000000000= 3.2E12
	6. Double (64)
	
	Byte->short->char->int->long->float->double
	
	Why we need type casting?
	 - When we are working in teams we might nneed to convert data from different data types.
	 - When we are working with math sometimes we need to get rid of decimal part as we are only interested in the non-decimal part.
	 
	What is the syntax?
	Explicit/narrowing/manual
		int box=1000;
		byte box2=(byte) box;
	
	Implicit/widening/automatic
	
		short box1=250;
		int box ;	
		
		==================================================
	If statements:
		- If else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision bases on some condition and provided data.
		
		If condition
		if else condition
		if else if condition
		nested if else condition
		
	Why we should learn about if else condition?
		- When we are solving real life problems
		- Like testing a web site our program needs to make alot of decisions.
		
	What is the syntax of if else condition?
		-It condition:
		boolean rich=true;
			if (rich)
			{
			System.out.println("Lets buy a Jet Island");
			}
